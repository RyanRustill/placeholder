# Placeholder – Portfolio Project

This is the very first public landing page for [ryanrustill.com](https://www.ryanrustill.com)  
It’s a temporary project made to hold the domain while development on my full portfolio site continues

> A single-file page. One blinking cursor. Infinite ambition.

## What This Is

This static page was built using **HTML** and **TailwindCSS** to match the eventual style of the final CMS-based site.

It’s intentionally minimal and meant to show a clear starting point.  
More features, pages, and content will come once development is complete.
